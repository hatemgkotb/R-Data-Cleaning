# R-Data-Cleaning

The aim of this code is to collect the sensor data from the UHCI repository and to generate a tidy dataset for certain measures only. Then to summarize this data by getting the average of each measure for each person-activity combination.

We have 6 activities:
* 1 WALKING
* WALKING_UPSTAIRS
* WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
* SITTING
* STANDING
* LAYING

I need to add that I assumed that all the files are located in the "data" folder of your working directory.
